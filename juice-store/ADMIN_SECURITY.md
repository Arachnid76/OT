# Admin Security Setup

## Current Security Implementation

The admin authentication has been improved with server-side validation. Here's how the password is now protected:

### 1. Server-Side Authentication
- Credentials are validated on the server via `/api/admin/auth` route
- Password is no longer visible in client-side JavaScript
- Authentication happens server-side, making it much harder to bypass

### 2. Environment Variables
To properly secure the credentials, create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```
ADMIN_USERNAME=akuaadepa
ADMIN_PASSWORD=djormor2022
```

### 3. Security Features
- ✅ Password field is masked in the UI
- ✅ Server-side validation
- ✅ Environment variable support
- ✅ Error handling for failed authentication
- ✅ Session persistence via localStorage

### 4. Production Security Recommendations

For production deployment, consider these additional security measures:

1. **Use a proper authentication system** like NextAuth.js or Auth0
2. **Hash passwords** using bcrypt or similar
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
4. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
5. **Add session management** with JWT tokens
6. **Implement 2FA** for additional security
7. **Regular password rotation**
8. **Log authentication attempts** for monitoring

### 5. Current Limitations

- Session is stored in localStorage (not secure for sensitive data)
- No rate limiting on login attempts
- No password hashing (using plain text comparison)
- No session expiration

### 6. How to Change Credentials

1. Update the environment variables in `.env.local`
2. Or modify the fallback values in `/api/admin/auth/route.js`
3. Restart your development server

## File Structure

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── admin/
│   │   └── page.js          # Admin page with login form
│   └── api/
│       └── admin/
│           └── auth/
│               └── route.js # Server-side authentication
.env.local                   # Environment variables (create this)
```

The admin page is now much more secure with server-side authentication!
